# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my solution repository for **Advent of Code 2024**! This repository contains my implementations for each of the daily puzzles using the Go programming language.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual programming event that runs throughout December. Each day presents a new programming challenge that participants can solve to unlock the next puzzle. The puzzles are designed to be solved using any programming language and are a fun way to test and improve your coding skills.

## Repository Structure

- `day1/` - Solutions for Day 1
- `day2/` - Solutions for Day 2
- `day3/` - Solutions for Day 3
- `...` - Additional directories for each day as needed

Each dayâ€™s solution includes:
- A Go implementation for solving the problem.

## Installation

To run these solutions locally, you will need:
- Go installed on your system ([install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install))

### Steps to Run a Solution

1. Clone this repository:
